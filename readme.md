# Deep Rock Galactic Save Editor

This is a DRG save editor written in python (3.12) using PyQt6 (6.7.0) and PySide6 (6.7.2).

## There are likely to be bugs, see the Known Issues and Troubleshooting section

## This Repo is aimed at providing continued support and updates for [robertnunn/DRG-Save-Editor](https://github.com/robertnunn/DRG-Save-Editor) as the original creator has "Largely moved on from this project"

That said, I'm in college right now and likely won't have time to implement many of the To-Do items at the end of this file, not without help anyway

## Requirements

if you are using the releases, you shouldn't need to worry about this section

any computer with __git__ (and/or a browser) to download the code, __pip__ to download the required python packages, __Python3__ (version>=3.9) to run the code, and a display should be able to make use of this project

## Installation

### Releases (recommended)

- download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/AnthonyMichaelTDM/DRG-Save-Editor/releases)
  - for windows download the `DRG-Save-Editor-windows.zip` file
  - for linux download the `DRG-Save-Editor-linux.tar.gz` file
- extract the contents of the archive to a folder of your choice and run the executable:
  - for windows run the `DRG Save Editor.exe` file
  - for linux run the `DRG Save Editor` file

### From Source

- clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/AnthonyMichaelTDM/DRG-Save-Editor.git` (or download the source code from github)
- open your terminal in the base directory of the project
- run `python --version` to ensure you have python 3.10 or later installed
- run `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment
- activate the virtual environment with the following command:
  - for windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
  - for linux: `source ./venv/bin/activate`
- install the required packages with pip using the following command: `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
- start the program with the `python ./src/main/python/main.py` command

if these instructions are unclear a member of the community, [NerdyJosh1](https://github.com/NerdyJosh1), has made a [video tutorial for windows users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h2-nZ2ptRo&ab_channel=NerdyJosh)

- Note: this tutorial was made for version 1.7.0/1.8.0 of the editor, some things have changed since then

## Known Issues

- The editor works by looking for specific values in the raw data of the save, it doesn't decode the data into a nice, neat python object. As a result if certain things aren't present in the save (e.g., >0 forged overclocks, certain resources) the editor will malfunction and give nonsensical results. The solution is to acquire at least one of the resources in game _then_ use the editor.

## Troubleshooting

If the editor opens but doesn't edit your save properly (i.e., values not being read properly, changes not being reflected in-game, etc) please open an issue, describe the problem as thoroughly as you can, and attach a copy of your save file from BEFORE any edits were attempted.

## Usage

### ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR SAVE FILE

The editor will make a backup of the save file you open in the same folder as the save file with the extension of `.old`. The editor makes this backup at the moment you open the save file.

The editor should be pretty self-explanatory, see the screenshot below.

Some notes:

- There is a context menu in the overclock tree listing to add overclocks to the inventory
- You can CTRL+Click on overclocks to select more than one
- Changing XP values will update the other relevant fields when the focus changes (i.e., click on a different part of the program or another program entirely)
- If you have promotions beyond Legendary 3 those promotions will be preserved as long as the drop-down is set to "Legendary 3+". If you don't have enough promotions for a specific dwarf and set them to "Legendary 3+" it will keep whatever the original value was.
