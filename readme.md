# Deep Rock Galactic Save Editor

This is a standalone DRG save editor written in python (3.6.12), using PyQt5 (5.9.2) and PySide2 (5.15.2) and packaged using the [fman build system](https://build-system.fman.io).

## There are likely to be bugs, see the Known Issues and Troubleshooting section!
## Repo is aimed at providing continued support and updates for [robertnunn/DRG-Save-Editor](https://github.com/robertnunn/DRG-Save-Editor) as the original creator has "Largely moved on from this project"
that said, I'm in college right now and likely won't have time to implement many of the To-Do items at the end of this file

## Requirements
any computer with __git__ (and/or a browser) to download the code, __pip__ to download the required python packages, __Python3__ to run the code, and a display should be able to make use of this project

## Installation
- clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/AnthonyMichaelTDM/DRG-Save-Editor.git` (or download the source code from github)
- open your terminal in the base directory of the project
- install the required packages with pip using the following command: `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
- start the program with the `python3 ./src/main/python/main.py` command

## Known Issues
- The editor works by looking for specific values in the raw data of the save, it doesn't decode the data into a nice, neat python object. As a result if certain things aren't present in the save (e.g., >0 forged overclocks, certain resources) the editor will malfunction and give nonsensical results. The solution is to acquire at least one of the resources in game _then_ use the editor.

## Troubleshooting
If the editor opens but doesn't edit your save properly (i.e., values not being read properly, changes not being reflected in-game, etc) please open an issue, describe the problem as thoroughly as you can, and attach a copy of your save file from BEFORE any edits were attempted.

## Usage
### ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR SAVE FILE!
The editor will make a backup of the save file you open in the same folder as the save file with the extension of `.old`. The editor makes this backup at the moment you open the save file.

The editor should be pretty self-explanatory, see the screenshot below.

Some notes:
- There is a context menu in the overclock tree listing to add overclocks to the inventory
- You can CTRL+Click on overclocks to select more than one
- Changing XP values will update the other relevant fields when the focus changes (i.e., click on a different part of the program or another program entirely)
- If you have promotions beyond Legendary 3 those promotions will be preserved as long as the drop-down is set to "Legendary 3+". If you don't have enough promotions for a specific dwarf and set them to "Legendary 3+" it will keep whatever the original value was.
- the `DRG Save Editor.zip` file is out of date, the only reason it's still in the repository is because there's really no point in removing it
